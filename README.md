# chatterbox

Hey you should write something about your app!

### USAGE

To set up this project, do the following:

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/crockeo/chatterbox.git
$ cd chatterbox
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

After that, you have two options. Either you can run the project as one would
while developing (automatically updating and reloading templates & source code),
or deploy the dependencies and run it statically.

Development version:

```bash
$ gulp
```

Production:

```bash
$ gulp deploy
$ node src/app.js
```

Alternatively if you want to be able to run the project in development mode
(with automatic reloading), you can use `gulp` (with no arguments).
